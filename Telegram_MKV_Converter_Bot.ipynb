    "\n",
    "*   **Runtime Limits:** Colab runtimes are not permanent. If the Colab runtime disconnects (due to inactivity, browser closure, or session limits imposed by Google Colab), your bot will stop. For a continuously running bot, Colab is generally not the ideal solution; you would typically use a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).\n",
    "*   **Streaming & Resource Limits:** The bot now uses streaming to handle larger files more efficiently by reducing disk and memory usage. However, Google Colab still has overall resource limitations (CPU, RAM, processing time per session). Very large or complex conversions might still hit these limits, causing the process to fail or the runtime to disconnect. The bot will attempt to inform you if a file seems excessively large.\n",
    "*   **Temporary Storage:** The bot no longer creates a `temp` directory for intermediate full file downloads/uploads, as processing is stream-based. This further reduces disk space concerns on Colab.\n",
    "*   **Stopping the Bot:** To stop the bot, you need to interrupt the execution of the cell where `!python bot.py` is running. You can do this by clicking the stop icon next to the cell, or by going to \"Runtime\" in the Colab menu and selecting \"Interrupt execution\" (or \"Restart runtime\").\n",
    "*   **Secrets Management:** While using Colab's secrets manager is good practice for tokens, remember that if you share your notebook (`.ipynb` file) directly, the *code* to access the secret is visible, though the secret value itself is not stored in the notebook file."
